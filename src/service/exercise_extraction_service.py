Given the following page content from a Spanish language workbook, identify and extract all distinct exercises.
For each exercise:
- Provide a short descriptive title if available (or assign a suitable one).
- Summarize the instructions for the exercise.
- Extract the list of questions or tasks for the student.

An 'exercise' is any part of the text that asks the student to do something: answer questions, fill in blanks, complete dialogues, translate sentences, etc.

Return the exercises in a structured JSON format with fields: title, instructions, and questions. 
If no exercises are present, return an empty list.

Present the following exercise to the student. First, greet the student, then explain the instructions clearly in Spanish, and then ask the questions one by one. Encourage the student to answer out loud.

Exercise Title: {title}

Instructions: {instructions}

Questions:
{questions}

In your speaking, use a friendly, encouraging tone. For example:
"Â¡Hola! Hoy vamos a practicar un ejercicio. {instructions}. Vamos a empezar con la primera pregunta: ..."

Don't write out of character. Only produce what you would say to the student as their Spanish teacher.

1. Word Context:
   - How the word is used in real situations
   - Common collocations and phrases
   - Register (formal/informal usage)

2. Word Relationships:
   - Related words (synonyms, antonyms)
   - Word families (derivations, common prefixes/suffixes)
   - False friends 
   
3. Usage Patterns:
   - Example sentences showing different contexts
   - Common expressions containing the word
   - Grammar patterns associated with the word

4. Memory Aids:
   - Etymology when helpful
   - Memorable mnemonics
   - Connection to cognates or similar words
   - Breaking down compound words

5. Cultural Context:
   - Cultural associations
   - Regional variations in meaning
   - Idiomatic usage

For each word, create multiple cards types:
- Basic recall (translation to desired language)
- Usage in context (fill-in-the-blank sentences)
- Collocation practice
- Picture/situation association
- Word family relationships

Ensure cards include:
- Clear pronunciation notes
- Relevant parts of speech
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Usage level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
